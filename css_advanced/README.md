# CSS, Advanced Project

## Understanding on CSS.
- CSS is a style sheet language, which allows the user to control the layout, colors, fonts, and the visuals on the web page.
- To add style to an element you just have to target the element you want to style.
- Setting an element as a class helps you identify an element by the class in order to change the specific element.
